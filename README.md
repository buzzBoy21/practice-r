# Recommendation

- I recommend practicing these words with a native Spanish speaker so they can guide you to correct pronunciation.

- There is a section with rules where you can see which rule is being applied at all times.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The rules for soft r have been eliminated
>
> - At the end of a syllable (green)
> - Behind a consonant that is part of the same syllable, as in the word (train)
>   they were replaced by:
>   When there is only one 'r' and it is neither at the beginning of the word nor followed by 'l', 'n', or 's', it is always soft.

I hope it is helpful to you ğŸ˜‹ğŸ˜‹ğŸ˜‹
